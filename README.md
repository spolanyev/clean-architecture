# About

This is a public repo of my private Rust project done in OOP-paradigm with TDD according to Uncle Bob's interpretation of clean architecture. Here are just a few screens and rust files. The project is under construction.

It is supposed to be a web API implemented with the standard library (deliberately without third-party crates). If you are hiring, contact me at [spolanyev@gmail.com](mailto:spolanyev@gmail.com?subject=Rust%3A%20vacancy) to access the private repo.
